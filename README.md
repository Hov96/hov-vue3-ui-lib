üöÄ Installation

npm i hov-vue3-ui-lib

üßë‚Äçüíª Usage
You can import and use any component directly in your Vue 3 application. The components are tree-shakeable, meaning you only bundle the parts of the library you actually use.

Example
Import and use a component in your .vue file:

<template>
  <div class="app-container">
    <h1>My Vue App</h1>
    <p>Using npm i hov-vue3-ui-lib components.</p>
    
    <!-- Example of a component from your library -->
    <h-pill size="md" color="blue">
      New
    </h-pill>
    
    <!-- An example button to control a modal -->
    <button @click="showModal = true">Show Modal</button>

    <!-- Example of a modal component -->
    <h-modal v-model="showModal" size="sm">
      <template #default>
        <h2>Hello from the Modal!</h2>
        <p>This is a simple modal component.</p>
      </template>
    </h-modal>

  </div>
</template>

<script setup>
import { ref } from 'vue';
import { HPill, HModal } from 'hov-vue3-ui-lib';

const showModal = ref(false);
</script>

<style scoped>
.app-container {
